# Game of Life
This is just a little fun thing for me to try! It's a terminal-based recreation of Conway's Game of 
Life, which may get rendered properly one day if I continue working on this.

Just an intial set-up first, treating this as an exercise in organising a repo as well as improving my 
Python coding just a little bit :)

Feel free to suggest improvements in issues, should you discover this repo!

Enjoy.
